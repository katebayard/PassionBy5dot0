# CookShelf

My Zip Code Wilmington Passion Project

CookShelf is an application to help home chefs discover the recipes hiding in their dusty cookbooks and recipe boxes.

# The problem
I have a bookshelf full of cookbooks that I rarely use now because searching for recipies online or in my Paprika online recipe manager is more convenient. I use the cookbooks when I know I want to make a specific recipe, but never to discover new ones. Taking each book down one by one to scan the index is a hassle.

# How CookShelf will solve this
Using CookShelf I will be able to search the recipes in my cookbooks from my desktop or mobile device, making the process of discovering new recipes in my cookbooks much easier and faster.

# Requirements
At a minimum, CookShelf should give me a listing of recipes that match my search criteria. Clicking on the recipe name will bring me to the recipe's page which will show which book it is in, the page number, and any other recipe specific information. I should also be able to browse the recipes at the cookbook level.

I should be able to add new cookbooks or individual recipe names to CookShelf, as well as delete cookbooks or recipes names.

Other features that would be nice to have is the ability to rate recipes, make notes about them, have a list of recipes I want to try in the future, and attach photos.
